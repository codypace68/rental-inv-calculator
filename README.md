## ✅ Good. Look into it a little more.
It passes the 1% rule but not the 2% rule. It's cash flow is great so maybe not passing the 2% rule is ok.

- 1 percent rule
-- If the monthly rent is at least 1 percent of the purchase price, then it's a good deal.
- 2 percent rule
-- If the monthly rent is at least 2 percent of the purchase price, then it's a great deal.
